## General Info

The Youth Income Prediction Model provides users with the convenience of predicting youth employment using the provided features.

## Technologies Used

The Youth Income Prediction Model is built using the following technologies:

- Python Pandas: Used for data exploration.
- Sci-kit Learn: Utilized for implementing machine learning models.
- Pickle: Used for saving trained models.

## Features

The prediction model uses the following features to make predictions:

- 'Status': The current status of the individual (e.g., employed, unemployed).
- 'Geography': The geographical location of the individual.
- 'Higher_Education': Binary variable indicating whether the individual has higher education or not.
- 'Schoolquintile': The quintile of the school the individual attended.
- 'Gender': The gender of the individual.

## Setup

To set up the Youth Employment Prediction Model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from https://github.com/The-DigitalAcademy/Maxwell_Predictive_Insights_Youth_Income_Prediction.git.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install pandas scikit-learn`.
3. Run the provided Python script to load the model and make predictions.

## Usage

To use the Youth Employment Prediction Model, you can follow these steps:

1. Prepare your input data with the required features.
2. Load the pre-trained model using the provided Python script.
3. Input your data into the model and obtain the predicted employment status.

## Project Status

The Youth Employment Prediction Model is complete.

## Room for Improvement

As the model is complete, there are areas where it can be improved:

- Collect more diverse and representative data to enhance prediction accuracy.
- Explore and incorporate additional relevant features to improve the model's performance.
- Optimize hyperparameters and evaluate different machine learning algorithms to achieve better results.
